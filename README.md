you need a bunch of other libs from python and python version should be 3.11.5 as then it wont work(even if its higher)
you need pip for python 
then install 
update your pip first:


python -m pip install --upgrade pip


then install:


pip install opencv-python mediapipe scikit-learn numpy joblib

and also use vs code cuz its gonna be easier for the repo
